   <h1>Speech Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning</h1>
   <h2>Abstract:-</h2>
     <p>
       <b>Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition which is gaining more
          popularity and need for it increases enormously. Identifying emotion from
          speech is a nontrivial task pertaining to the ambiguous definition of emotion
          itself. In this work, we adopt a feature engineering based approach to tackle the
          task of speech emotion recognition. We are using machine learning techniques,
          to recognize emotion and classify the emotion according to the speech signals.

   <div id="Application">Emotion Recognition is used in call center for classifying calls according to
      emotions. Emotion Recognition serves as the performance parameter for
      conversational analysis, thus identifying the unsatisfied customer, customer
      satisfaction so on. SER is used in-car board system based on information of the
      mental state of the driver can be provided to the system to initiate his/her safety
      preventing accidents to happen.
