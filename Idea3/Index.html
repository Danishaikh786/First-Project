   <h1>Making a SSH client using WebSockets and Python</h1>
   <h2>Abstract:-</h2>
     <p>
       <b>SSH, also known as Secure Shell, is a network protocol that provides
        administrators with a secure way to access a remote servers. SSH establishes a
        cryptographically secured connection between two parties (client and server),
        authenticating each side to the other, and passing commands and output back
        and forth. For our project we have implemented a simple SSH using websockets,
        with the server written in Python and the client
        in Javascript. User and password authentication is also implemented. The
        password is encrypted before sending and hashed before storing.

   <div id="Application">It provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote servers. It has
    many useful applications that solve all kinds of communication and security
    problems. The most obvious use for SSH is to allow remote machines to access
    a shell on the host computer.
